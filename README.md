# G1OS

A [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) based distribution designed specifically for the **Ginger G1** 3D Printer. It includes all the necessary software and optimizations to get started with **Klipper Firmware** and **Mainsail** for 3D printing with **pellet extrusion** technology.

This project is a **fork of [MainsailOS](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/MainsailOS)**, tailored for the unique requirements of pellet-based 3D printing with the Ginger G1.

-   [Mainsail (Web Interface for Klipper)](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail)

<!-- ## How to install G1OS?

Detailed installation instructions can be found in our [documentation](https://docs-os.mainsail.xyz), with a section dedicated to the **Ginger G1**. We recommend using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://docs-os.mainsail.xyz/getting-started/raspberry-pi-os-based) for installation. -->

# FAQ

**Q:** How do I report a bug?  
**A:** Please ensure it's not a configuration issue with:

-   Klipper
-   Moonraker
-   Crowsnest
-   Sonar

If the issue is specific to the **G1OS** setup or the Ginger G1 printer, report it via the **G1OS** GitHub Issues section. Provide detailed information to help us resolve the problem quickly.

**Q:** What is the philosophy behind G1OS?  
**A:** We maintain a **KISS** principleâ€”Keep It Simple and Straightforward. G1OS is built on the same foundation as **MainsailOS**, but optimized for pellet printing with the Ginger G1. We aim to keep things as close to the Raspberry Pi OS and MainsailOS documentation as possible, providing extra documentation only where needed.

**Q:** How can I contribute?  
**A:** Contributions are always welcome! Please check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/MainsailOS/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways to support the project or submit code.
